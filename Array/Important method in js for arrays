    The push() method adds one or more elements to the end of an array and returns the new length of the array.
    
Array.prototype.concat()
    The concat() method is used to merge two or more arrays. This method does not change the existing arrays, but instead returns a new array.
    
Array.prototype.slice()
    The slice() method returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array into a new array object selected from start to end (end not included) where start and end represent the index 
    of items in that array. The original array will not be modified.
